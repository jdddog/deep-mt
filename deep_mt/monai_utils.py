    Set random seed for modules to enable or disable deterministic training.

    Args:
        seed: the random seed to use, default is np.iinfo(np.int32).max.
            It is recommended to set a large seed, i.e. a number that has a good balance
            of 0 and 1 bits. Avoid having many 0 bits in the seed.
            if set to None, will disable deterministic training.
        use_deterministic_algorithms: Set whether PyTorch operations must use "deterministic" algorithms.
        additional_settings: additional settings that need to set random seed.

    Note:

        This function will not affect the randomizable objects in :py:class:`monai.transforms.Randomizable`, which
        have independent random states. For those objects, the ``set_random_state()`` method should be used to
        ensure the deterministic behavior (alternatively, :py:class:`monai.data.DataLoader` by default sets the seeds
        according to the global random state, please see also: :py:class:`monai.data.utils.worker_init_fn` and
        :py:class:`monai.data.utils.set_rnd`).
